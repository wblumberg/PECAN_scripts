This directory contains scripts that will pull realtime cloud base height data from
ASOS/AWOS stations around the US for use in the AERIoe runs.

The scripts are dependent upon the UCAR Motherlode server as their data source.

They are also dependent on the following libaries:

1.) netCDF4-python
2.) Numpy

These libaries can be downloaded by installing the Anaconda Python Distribution:
