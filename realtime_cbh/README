This directory contains scripts that will pull realtime cloud base height data from
ASOS/AWOS stations around the US for use in the AERIoe runs.

The scripts are dependent upon the UCAR Motherlode server as their data source.

They are also dependent on the following libaries:

1.) netCDF4-python
2.) Numpy

These libaries can be downloaded by installing and using the Anaconda Python Distribution:

http://continuum.io/downloads

Once downloaded, the realtime_aerioe_cloud.py script can be run by typing:
    
    python realtime_aerioe_cloud.py <out_path>

When this script runs, it will pull the latest world-wide METAR data and generate files
for each site specified in the Python file.  The sites it should pull are listed in the
"sites" variable.

<out_path> is the command line argument that indicates the path the cloud base height
netCDF files should be saved to.
