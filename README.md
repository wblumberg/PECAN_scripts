## PECAN Scripts and Files

This GIT respository contains various codes for generating plots and data for use in the PECAN PISA network (will also contain readers and data source files for the PECAN PISA ensemble output), although those will also eventually be merged with SHARPpy.  This directory will also contain the configuration files for the PECAN SHARPpy distribution.  All these codes are contained and kept under revision control here for safe keeping and easy distribution.

Code distributions that should also be downloaded:

- netCDF4-python
- Numpy
- IPython
- matplotlib

These all can be downloaded using the Anaconda Python Distribution:

Directories:
 - realtime_cbh: generates files for AERIoe to use 
 - plotting: scripts that generate convection indices time series for plotting
 - model_prior: scripts that generate the AERI model priors
 - oe-indices: a directory that contains the OE-indices repository
 - sharppy: a directory that contains the SHARPpy config files and decoders for PECAN
